# 3D Models Placeholder

This directory will contain the 3D models for the clothing items in the application. For the first milestone demonstration, we're using basic Three.js geometries to represent clothing items.

In the actual implementation, this directory would contain `.glb` files with proper 3D models of clothing items, including:

- tshirt.glb
- jeans.glb
- jacket.glb
- dress.glb
- sweater.glb
- skirt.glb

These models would be created using the 3D scanning technology described in the technical specifications document, with proper materials, textures, and physics properties.
